# RTOS-Sender_Reciever-Project
ðŸ“„ Project Summary

This project simulates a simple network communication system using FreeRTOS, implementing two protocols: Stop-and-Wait and Go-Back-N.
It models senders, a switch, and receivers communicating over a lossy channel with random packet drops and delays.
The system handles acknowledgments, retransmissions, and tracks throughput for performance evaluation.
